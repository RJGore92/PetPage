    <h2>Jazzy Blue, The Mini Australian Shepherd.</h2>

    <p>Jazzy Blue, the Mini Australian Shepherd is a very playful and energetic puppy just under two years of age.
    Born the day after Christmas in 2016, Jazz is a sweetheart towards family and protective of home, but will bark quite a bit at strangers.  She refuses to bite, however.
    With all the love in the heart of my family, Jazz returns that affection with lots of snuggles and puppy kisses, and happily plays with memebers of her family with various toys.
    On top of this, she also has a habit of messing around with the bones we bring her, sometimes finding enjoyment in dropping them on the hard floor and wondering who will pick it back up for her.  </p>
    <br>
    <p>Jazzy Blue's favorite toys and items tend to be the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A plush bone with red fabric material and a squeaker inside.</li>
      <li>A splash bomb for a fetch ball</li>
      <li>Bones of various types, either with marrow, peanut butter, or beef.</li>
      <li>Sometimes clothes or other objects she can tug on or drag around (She's been better about not doing this, though.)</li>
    </ul>
